    <p>Ragnar Lothbrok: The central figure, driven by curiosity and ambition to sail west, becoming a legendary figure
        but ultimately meeting a brutal end.
        Lagertha: Ragnar's fierce shieldmaiden wife, a powerful warrior and queen, whose story continues with her own
        struggles and eventual tragic death.
